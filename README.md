## My name is Vinicius Martins and here are some professional and academic curiosities about me:

- I have been studying technology since 2013, but I had already been interested in working in the field since my teenage years;
- I have a degree in Computer Science;
- I hold a technical diploma in Computer Networks;
- I have been working in Process Automation for almost 7 years;
- My first passion for programming came through Python;
- I am currently trying to strengthen my technical side, as I want to build an increasingly strong knowledge base;
- If you are curious about the area in which I work, feel free to create a connection with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinicius-m-martins/) to talk about it;
